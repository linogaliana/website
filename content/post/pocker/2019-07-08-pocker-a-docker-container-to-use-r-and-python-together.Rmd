## Genesis

I started to use continuous integration with gitlab a few weeks ago and up to a few days was really happy with `rocker` image (basically `docker` + `R`).

I became ambitious and started to write a `markdown` that was comparing `R` and `Python` speed on simple operations. It was working fine on my laptop (anaconda is installed). However, because anaconda is not available in `rocker` image, markdown compilation naturally failed. I thus started the project to create a `docker` image that would do the job, i.e. that would integrate `Python` and `R` together. The container I propose is not well-suited for `Python` only repository, its goal is to ease the pass-through between  `Python` and `R`  

Since I am a beginner in `docker` ecosystem, it has not been an easy path. When I was thinking the solution would be trivial to implement I was planning to make the repository private. However, I think now that the solution produced can help people. I decided to make it public. To make the project as reproducible as possible, I ended up with that complex workflow:

* [`github`](https://github.com/linogaliana/pocker) connected to `dockerhub` to build image base from `DockerFile`
* [`gitlab`](https://gitlab.com/linogaliana/pocker) with continuous integration using `/gitlabCI/.simple_configuration.yml` example file as a reproducible workflow
* [`dockerhub`](https://cloud.docker.com/u/linogaliana/repository/docker/linogaliana/pocker) that builds automatically from github repository the docker image

![*Complex workflow, simple image*](/img/pocker/workflow.png)

This is not the most natural workflow. If you go into project history, you might see that I did not adopt initially that workflow. I adopted it after merging branches from two separated project that were pursuing the same goal. This complex set up presents an advantage for reproducibility: each time project updates are pushed, the code used to build `pocker` image and the example of use from continuous integration is updated. 

I should warn people used to create docker image that I might not have created the most parsimonious image necessary to run `R` and `Python` together. I would welcome pull request to improve `pocker` repository


## Some explanations

`DockerFile` is used to build the image. The main steps are the following:

* Start from `rocker/verse` container that avoids re-installing tidyverse each time a CI/CD job is ran. 
* Install `python 3` and `anaconda`
* Add `conda` binary directory in path
* Install `reticulate` package


In `gitlabCI` directory, you will find scripts useful for continuous integration related to `docker` project:

* `complete_configuration.yml`: the gitlab CI/CD configuration file I was using before building my own docker image. It starts from `rocker/verse` and follows the same steps that the `Dockerfile` that has been presented
* `simple_configuration.yml`: gitlab CI/CD configuration I use now that `pocker` container is built

The other scripts `build.R`, `scripts/*` are here to propose tests for the configuration obtained from `gitlab` CI/CD.
