<h2>Genesis</h2>
<p>I started to use continuous integration with gitlab a few weeks ago and up to a few days was really happy with <code>rocker</code> image (basically <code>docker</code> + <code>R</code>).</p>
<p>I became ambitious and started to write a <code>markdown</code> that was comparing <code>R</code> and <code>Python</code> speed on simple operations. It was working fine on my laptop (anaconda is installed). However, because anaconda is not available in <code>rocker</code> image, markdown compilation naturally failed. I thus started the project to create a <code>docker</code> image that would do the job, i.e. that would integrate <code>Python</code> and <code>R</code> together. The container I propose is not well-suited for <code>Python</code> only repository, its goal is to ease the pass-through between <code>Python</code> and <code>R</code></p>
<p>Since I am a beginner in <code>docker</code> ecosystem, it has not been an easy path. When I was thinking the solution would be trivial to implement I was planning to make the repository private. However, I think now that the solution produced can help people. I decided to make it public. To make the project as reproducible as possible, I ended up with that complex workflow:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/linogaliana/pocker"><code>github</code></a> connected to <code>dockerhub</code> to build image base from <code>DockerFile</code></li>
<li><a href="https://gitlab.com/linogaliana/pocker"><code>gitlab</code></a> with continuous integration using <code>/gitlabCI/.simple_configuration.yml</code> example file as a reproducible workflow</li>
<li><a href="https://cloud.docker.com/u/linogaliana/repository/docker/linogaliana/pocker"><code>dockerhub</code></a> that builds automatically from github repository the docker image</li>
</ul>

<p class="caption"><em>Complex workflow, simple image</em></p>
</div>
<p>This is not the most natural workflow. If you go into project history, you might see that I did not adopt initially that workflow. I adopted it after merging branches from two separated project that were pursuing the same goal. This complex set up presents an advantage for reproducibility: each time project updates are pushed, the code used to build <code>pocker</code> image and the example of use from continuous integration is updated.</p>
<p>I should warn people used to create docker image that I might not have created the most parsimonious image necessary to run <code>R</code> and <code>Python</code> together. I would welcome pull request to improve <code>pocker</code> repository</p>

<div id="some-explanations" class="section level2">
<h2>Some explanations</h2>
<p><code>DockerFile</code> is used to build the image. The main steps are the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Start from <code>rocker/verse</code> container that avoids re-installing tidyverse each time a CI/CD job is ran.</li>
<li>Install <code>python 3</code> and <code>anaconda</code></li>
<li>Add <code>conda</code> binary directory in path</li>
<li>Install <code>reticulate</code> package</li>
</ul>
<p>In <code>gitlabCI</code> directory, you will find scripts useful for continuous integration related to <code>docker</code> project:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>complete_configuration.yml</code>: the gitlab CI/CD configuration file I was using before building my own docker image. It starts from <code>rocker/verse</code> and follows the same steps that the <code>Dockerfile</code> that has been presented</li>
<li><code>simple_configuration.yml</code>: gitlab CI/CD configuration I use now that <code>pocker</code> container is built</li>
</ul>
<p>The other scripts <code>build.R</code>, <code>scripts/*</code> are here to propose tests for the configuration obtained from <code>gitlab</code> CI/CD.</p>
