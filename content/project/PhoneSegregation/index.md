summary: I explore the evolution of segregation in the three French biggest cities within a typical day using individual mobile phone data combined with traditional data sources. I propose an innovative methodology to build within-day segregation indices and study segregation dynamics at fine spatial granularity

I bring together mobile phone and geocoded tax data on the three biggest French cities to shed a
new light on segregation that accounts for population flows. Mobility being a key factor to reduce
spatial segregation, I build a gravity model on an unprecedent scale to estimate the heterogeneity in
travel costs.
