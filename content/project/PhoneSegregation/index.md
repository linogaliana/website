summary: I use mobile phone data to measure the evolution of city spatial income distribution across time. I propose an innovative methodology to build within-day segregation indexes and study segregation dynamics at fine spatial granularity

I explore the evolution of segregation in the three French biggest
cities within a typical day using individual mobile phone data combined with traditional data sources.

Until recently, because they were based on available data, most of the studies on segregation were
focused on where people live. However, individuals tend to visit places outside their living environment,
exposing them to people from other neighborhoods. To better understand *experienced segregation* [Athey et al.,
2019],
one needs to take into account where people go
and who they mix with in those places [Davis et al., 2019].
