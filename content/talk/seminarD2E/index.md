abstract: That paper proposes an innovative methodology to study segregation dynamics at fine spatial and temporal granularity for both low- and high-income groups. We build infra-day segregation indexes using individual geocoded position records from anonymized mobile phone data. We adopt a Monte-Carlo procedure to estimate phone users' likelihood of belonging to low- or high-income groups. We estimate infra-day segregation indexes by taking into account co-presence at 500x500 meters cells. We propose robustness checks and compare results with residential segregation indexes derived from tax data.
